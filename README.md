# Project Euler

Here I am posting my answers in Python of some of the challengues of projecteuler.net with the aim of helping any person who may be new to programming and need to see how the solutions can be portrait. While Project Euler encourages to solve this challengues individually, my only interest is to help those who may need help in figuring out a problem or searching for alternative solutions to theirs. These days with AI language models these problems can also be improved or solved through these tools. 

### Let's help each other!

While this are my solutions, I am aware that these solutions can be improved, so if you have comments on my solutions I invite you to collaborate and even create a pull request updating my code!
