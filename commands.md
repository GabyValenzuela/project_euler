Hola, here are some useful sublime text commands

* add a multi-cursor above/below: `ctrl-shift-up` / `ctrl-shift-down`
* multi-select next occurrence of the variable / name currently under the cursor: `cmd-D`
  * deselect the current multi-selection and move to the next one: `cmd-K cmd-D`
  * undo the last cmd-D: `cmd-U`
* move line(s) up/down: `ctrl-cmd-up` / `ctrl-cmd-down`
